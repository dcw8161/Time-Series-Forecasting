# Introduction
Time series forecasting is a crucial area in machine learning that deals with predicting future values based on historical data points ordered by time. Here are the key points:

 ## 1.	Supervised Learning Approach:
  - Time series forecasting can be framed as a supervised learning problem
  - By re-framing time series data, you gain access to standard linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms
  - This allows you to apply techniques like regression, decision trees, and neural networks to predict future values

## 2.	Methods for Time Series Forecasting:
There are various methods for time series forecasting, including both classical and deep learning approaches:
  - Classical Methods: These include Autoregression (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA), and more
  - Deep Learning Methods: These involve neural networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

## 3. Applications:
  - Time series forecasting is widely used in finance, economics, weather prediction, stock market analysis, demand forecasting, and more
  - Accurate predictions help businesses make informed decisions and plan for the future
