# Introduction
Time series forecasting is a crucial area in machine learning that deals with predicting future values based on historical data points ordered by time. Here are the key points:

 ## 1. 1.	Supervised Learning Approach:
  •	Time series forecasting can be framed as a supervised learning problem.
  •	By re-framing time series data, you gain access to standard linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms.
  •	This allows you to apply techniques like regression, decision trees, and neural networks to predict future values.
